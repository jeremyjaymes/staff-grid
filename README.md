# Staff Grid
Plugin sets up team post type and shortcodes for displaying a column based "Meet the Staff (Team, Employees)" section on WordPress websites. 

* Still under development not quite ready for out of the box use, but with some tweaking it would make a good point A. *

## Notes
Tried to keep the styles and functionality pretty vanilla so it can be modified easily. Working towards making it easier to modify via hooks/filters.

## Todo
* Add better grid with some options
* Make post type labels filterable
* Additional hooks/filters to make more customizable for developers
